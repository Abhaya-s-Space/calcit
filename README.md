// Example 1: Calculating income tax using the old regime
const taxableIncome = 850000;
const incomeTax = calculateIncomeTax(taxableIncome);

console.log(
  `Income tax for ‚Çπ${taxableIncome} under the old regime is ‚Çπ${incomeTax}`
);

// Example 2: Advanced tax calculation comparing both regimes
const grossIncome = 1200000;
const hraExemption = 150000;
const section80CDeduction = 150000;
const section80DDeduction = 50000;
const otherDeductions = 100000;

const { oldRegimeTax, newRegimeTax, recommendedRegime } =
  calculateAdvancedIncomeTax(
    grossIncome,
    hraExemption,
    section80CDeduction,
    section80DDeduction,
    otherDeductions
  );

console.log(`Tax under old regime: ‚Çπ${oldRegimeTax}`);

// Example 1: Calculating TDEE based on user's inputs
const weight = 70; // in kgs
const height = 175; // in cms
const age = 30; // in years
const gender = "male"; // enum
const activityLevel = "moderate";

const { tdee, category } = calculateCalories(
  weight,
  height,
  age,
  gender,
  activityLevel
);

console.log(`TDEE for a ${age}-year-old ${gender}: ${tdee} calories/day`);
console.log(`Activity category: ${category}`);

// Example 2: Calculating macronutrient distribution based on TDEE and goal
const goal = "balanced"; // Can be "balanced", "low_carb", "high_carb", or "ketogenic"

const { protein, fat, carbs } = calculateMacros(tdee, goal);

console.log(`Protein: ${macros.protein} grams/day`);
console.log(`Fat: ${macros.fat} grams/day`);
console.log(`Carbs: ${macros.carbs} grams/day`);
```
